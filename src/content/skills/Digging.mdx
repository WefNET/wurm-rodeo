[Digging](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Digging) in Wurm Online is a fundamental skill which is required to terraform the land and to gather resources for other crafting professions.

## The Basics

### Slope **Difficulty**

Every 5 slope adds 1 difficulty to digging. You could grind up skill in Digging by digging at the base of a high slope (max 300).

### Tile Difficulty

These are the base difficulties per tile. They can be adjusted by the formula: 1 + (the highest slope from that corner/5, rounded down):

| Tile | Difficulty |
|:- | -:|
| Dirt | 0 |
| Peat | 0 |
| Sand | 10 |
| Moss | 10 |
| Clay | 20 |
| Tundra | 20 |
| Marsh | 30 |
| Tar | 35 |
| Steppe | 40 |


### Don't Level for Skillgain

Using the ["Level"](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Level) action produces only 33% of potential skill gains compared to digging to inventory or digging-to-pile. **Warning**:Dig-to-pile might set off some anti-macro code if you are putting items into a BSB; this would stop skill gains.

### Shovel Quality (and Enchantments)

Most likely, you will see best gains using a "[skiller](/skills/skillers)" type shovel at 1QL with a high as possible CoC enchant. You want long action timers, so no WoA is needed.

You can save your high QL / runed / WoA enchanted shovel when you need higher QL resources for other professions, like Pottery.

### Recommended Grind

| Skill | Vein |
|-:|:-|
| 0-70 | Dirt / Sand / Moss |
| 50+ | Clay |
| 80+ | Tar |

### Other Techniques

Just terraform a couple (2 - 3) large deeds, like I did, over a ten year period. With my last big deed project, I lowered every tile of my 3000+ tile deed by 50 dirts. I never grinded Digging, but it is my highest gathering skill.
