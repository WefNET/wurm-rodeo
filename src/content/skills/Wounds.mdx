Getting hurt in order to reduce your effective skill level is a popular way to grind certain skills.

## The Basics

The goal is to produce a [wound](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Wound) that can be "frozen", thus reducing your stamina and effective skill and leading to longer action timers. A ton of trial and error needs to be done to find the right parameters.

### Getting a Wound

There are several fun and exciting ways to get wounded on purpose in the game. You're looking to produce a single bad or severe wound that will be ["frozen"](#freezing-a-wound).

| Method | Notes |
|- | -|
| Lava | Standing on a lava tile will produce damage. It's easy to step off and get consistent wounds. |
| Falling Damage | Depending on height, you can get wounded at a predicable level. |
| Sparring | Having a spar with an alt or a friend can produce wounds in specific parts of the body, depending on combatant attack target positioning. A lot of experimentation will need to be done to produce consistent wounds in the right place. |

### Freezing a Wound

You can freeze wounds so that they never improve nor worsen. The common wisdom is that a potency 6 [healing cover](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Healing_cover) should do the trick, but your mileage may vary.

Benefits of frozen wounds:

- Stamina is frozen,
- Longer timers,
- Less materials used, like favor cordage, chopped corn, etc.

### Wounds in all the Right Places

Getting hurt in certain areas can mess with how well you perform. So, if you have 70 body strength but a 60 wound on your lower back, you can still mine rock or chop trees for a good amount of body strength per hour. Wounds on your lower back or upper back affect body strength, while a hurt crotch impacts body control, and a facial injury slows down your mind speed.

#### Neck Wound

A wound on the neck results in a percentage reduction of the [Channeling](/skills/channeling) skill. The calculation for this is the wound damage number divided by 76, which yields the percentage reduction. For example, a 63-point neck wound is calculated as 63 / 76, resulting in an approximately 83% reduction of effective skill. This would reduce a channeling skill of 80 to 13. This means that gains in skill can be achieved with casts for "Light Token", "Opulence," and "Morning Fog," all of which have a difficulty level of 10.
