Wurm Online has a complex system of runes. Some runes can be used to accelerate skill gains. Let's do a deep dive into Rune-ology.

## The Basics

[Runes](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Runes) are made using [rift mats](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Rift#Rift_Materials) and metal lumps. These runes can be added to both your imping tools and the items being imped.

## The Runes

### Glimmersteel Rune of Fo

- 10% skill level bonus

This rune works well on your imping tools, if you are using ["sweet spot"](/skills/sweet-spot) imping or if you are pushing high QL imps.

### Glimmersteel Rune of Liblia

- 10% usage speed

This rune could be added to your imping tools, if you do a lot of lower QL level imping. With faster imps, you could get an item's QL up into the ["sweet spot"](/skills/sweet-spot) faster using this rune. Of course, faster speed implies faster action timers, which could lead to lower skill gains.

### Brass Rune of Magranon

- 10% more quality when imped

This rune could be added to an item being improved. This rune is useful get an item's QL up into the ["sweet spot"](/skills/sweet-spot) quicker.

### Copper Rune of Vynora

- 7.5% Higher improve chance

This rune could be added to an item being improved. It's valuable for imping in the ["sweet spot"](/skills/sweet-spot).

### Caveats

- You can only have one rune on an item at a time, unless the item have been created from [Restoration](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Restoration) with [Archaeology](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Archaeology).
