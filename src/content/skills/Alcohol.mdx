Getting drunk in Wurm Online in order to increase the crafting difficulty is a popular way to grind certain skills.

## The Basics

As a player's skill rises, it becomes easier to craft things, thus reducing the skill ticks gained, eventually to zero. [Alcohol](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Alcohol) impairs a player's ability to perform crafting tasks. This temporarily increases the difficulty of crafting items in game. It is common knowledge that erforming crafting tasks with a 75% chance of creation is the "sweet spot" for skill gains.

**Note**: Alcohol offers _no_ advantage in imping items for skill, and imping remains the best possible grinding method for a majority of crafting skills.

### Getting Drunk

Intoxication is measured as a power between 0 and 100, with 100 being "perfectly drunk". This power scales in proportion with the increased crafting difficulties.

Various drinks offer differing powers:

| Drink | Power |
|:- | -:|
|Moonshine | 40|
|Whisky | 35|
|Brandy | 35|
|Vodka | 30|
|Rum | 22|
|Gin | 20|
|Rice wine | 15|
|Red wine | 13|
|White wine | 11|
|Cider | 8|
|Mead | 6|
|Beer | 4|

Small sips of alcohol are recommended, which can be managed by using a reed pen or a measuring jug.

### Skills Affected

Alcohol is used to increase the difficulty of all cooking actions:
    - Cooking
    - Hot Food cooking
    - Baking
    - Beverages

Also for any simple crafting creations or crafting with "continued" actions. This could be used at higher levels with skills that don't have an "improvement" available.

### Caveats

Not much is mentioned about alcohol in other grinding guides. Many grinders consider alcohol to be too much effort for little gains.
