[Locksmithing](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Locksmithing) can be a valuable skill in PVE and PVP. Turning metals into [locks that can be sacrificed for favor](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Favor#Double_bonus_materials) is one method of grinding channeling for a Magranon priest. (I'll stick to cordage ropes though, since they are created from a 'renewable' resource.) One of my favorite uses for Locksmithing is to make padlocks for use for [quality locks](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Quality_lock) for storage containers.

## The Basics

Since Locksmithing is a "creation only" skill, meaning there is no way to gain skill improving items, you are stuck creating [Locksmithing items](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Category:Locksmithing_items) for skill.

#### Spamming Keys

If you have access to some copper, you can spam [keys](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Key). Make a small padlock, then take the key and some clay and create a [key mould](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Key_mould). Fire this mould in a kiln or forge. Then enchant your pottery key mould with <Definition text="CoC" title="Circle of Cunning" link="https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Circle_of_cunning" />. With a hot copper lump, some sleep bonus, and coffee, you can spam keys using a small amount of copper (0.05kg) for each. Once you have 100 keys, sacrifice them in your gods altar.

#### Spamming Lockpicker

Once you have 25 skill in Locksmithing you can begin to create [Lockpicks](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Lock_picks). Lockpicks only use 0.05kg of the metal during creation, so it's easy on resources. Using a "[skiller](/skills/skillers)" small anvil, with sleep bonus, coffee, action timer maintenance, and patience, craft lockpicks until you cannot stand it anymore.

#### Spamming Locks

If you are spamming locks for favor, chose [Door locks](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Door_lock) as they don't make a key on creation. Small padlocks use less material but you'll need to sacrifice twice as often.

### Recommended Grind

| Skill | Craftable |
|:-|:-|
| 0-40+ | Copper keys |
| 40-? | Lockpicks |

Note: I'm still getting great ticks making copper keys with a highly enchanted key mould at 47 skill.
