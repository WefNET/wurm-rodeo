You can double your imping skill gains in Wurm Online, above the bonuses from sleep bonus and other skilling bonuses, by imping items above your "sweet spot".

## The Basics

You will gain 2x the skill imping items at or above the "sweet spot" quality. This doesn't happen every tick, but maybe 1 in every 4.

The sweet spot formula, for optimal skill gains while imping is:

> Skill * 0.77 + 23

### Caveats

Getting an item into the "sweet spot" might be hard for newcomers. Ask a neighbor or alliance member to make or imp an item for you.

Since it's much harder to imp an item 10-15 points above your skill, the "sweet spot" is much more effective about 57 in skill.
