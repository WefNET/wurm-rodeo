Channeling is one of the more difficult skills to master because of the variety configurations in setting up a skill grind, at a certain skill level, per priest type, per other details.

## The Basics

### Spell Difficulty

The difficult of a grinding spell should be 10-25 points under your channeling skill. You are shooting to cast a spell with a spell power rating of 0 or better for skill gains. A lower difficulty means a better chance of a successful cast.

### Alignment

Since alignment could effect the spell difficulty, a lower alignment is favorable for a spell grind. The consensus is that from channeling skill 30-70 you want your alignment low. Once you have a high channeling skill, alignment means nothing.

### Diety Influence

Grinding near your diety's domain or altar could decrease the spell difficulty and ruin your skill gains. Ideally, you want to be grinding spells under the influence of a diety other than your own.

### Casting Bonuses

Cloth armour bonus could effect the spell difficulty, so you are better off grinding with the 30% penalty for wearing plate or chain armour. I single plate boot or glove will do the trick.

### Links

Having another priest [link](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Linking) to your grinding priest increases the difficulty of the spell being cast by 3. This will allow lower diffulty spells to be cast with a higher channeling skill

> __Warning:__ a maximum or 2 links should be used for a grinding session, as there is a skill gain penalty for 3 or more links.

### Favor

If you link with other priests, they should be the "batteries" for you favor store. This is important if you are using the [Neck Wound](#neck-wound) method of skilling, since sacrificing over 50 favor worth of items could heal you.
