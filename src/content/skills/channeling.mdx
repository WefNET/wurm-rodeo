Channeling is one of the more difficult skills to master because of the variety configurations in setting up a skill grind, at a certain skill level, per priest type, per other details.

## The Basics

### Spell Difficulty

The difficulty of a grinding spell should be 10 to 25 points below your channeling skill. You aim to cast a spell with a spell power rating of 0 or higher for skill gains. A lower difficulty increases the chance of a successful cast, but you will not make significant gains with spells that are too easy.

### Alignment

Since alignment could effect the spell difficulty, a lower alignment is favorable for a spell grind. The consensus is that from channeling skill 30-70 you want your alignment low. Once you have a high channeling skill, alignment means nothing.

### Diety Influence

Grinding near your diety's domain or altar could decrease the spell difficulty and ruin your skill gains. Ideally, you want to be grinding spells under the influence of a diety other than your own.

### Casting Bonuses

Cloth armour bonus could effect the spell difficulty, so you are better off grinding with the 30% penalty for wearing plate or chain armour. I single plate boot or glove will do the trick.

### Links

Having another priest [link](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Linking) to your grinding priest increases the difficulty of the spell being cast by 3. This will allow lower diffulty spells to be cast with a higher channeling skill. Linking also grants the favor of the linked priest to the grinding priest.

> __Warning:__ a maximum or 2 links should be used for a grinding session, as there is a skill gain penalty for 3 or more links.

### Favor

If you link with other priests, they should be the "batteries" for you favor store. This is important if you are using the [Neck Wound](#neck-wound) method of skilling, since sacrificing  50 or more favor worth of items could heal you.

| Vynora | Opulence | Fire Protection | Glacial | Lurker in the Deep |

> *Grind to 50 with low alignment

### Vesseling Gems

As you play Wurm, you will soon start amassing gems. Gems come from prayer (and you will do lots of that as a priest), from digging, mining, looting a newbies fallen deed, etc. Many early grinding guides for Channeling discussed [Vesseling](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Vessel) gems at great length.

All priests can Vessel gems. It's a high difficulty (70) spell and a potentially low favor (7.5 min) cast, meaning its an attractive target for skill gains. However, it's a 30 second timer, which adds to the patience requuired grinding with Vessel.

Gems under 10ql can take a Vessel spell, and with success, the gem is damaged. You can cast under 10ql gems several times, making them more beneficial and more expensive in the trade markets. (10ql and under gems sell for 2c per QL in the Southern Freedom Isles, whereas above are only 1c per QL.)

I will Vessel a sack full of gems sorted by QL, with the lowest first. The low QL gems burn down my favor to zero, then I can store a lower amount of favor in the above 10ql gems. When you "use" a Vesseled gem, you get the stored favor, and the gem is damaged by the amount of favor you recovered. This means you can cast a higher QL gem several times before it "poofs". The secret to the process is to cast a higher QL gem with the lowest amount of favor possible, minimally 7.5.
