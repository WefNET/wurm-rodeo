A "skiller" in Wurm Online is a low quality tool with a higher <Definition text="CoC" title="Circle of Cunning" link="https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Circle_of_cunning" /> cast. For instance, a 1ql hatchet with a 99 strength CoC cast.

## The Basics

The lower quality of the tool increases the difficulty and length of certain actions. Both difficulty and action length will increase your skill gains. And of course, we all should know that a <Definition text="CoC" title="Circle of Cunning" link="https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Circle_of_cunning" /> enchant increases skill gains, the higher the better.

### Caveats

Not all tools should be skillers. Skillers don't really work on imping tools. The quality of your improvement tools should be around your improvement skill.

Skillers are great for gathering tools: pickaxe, shovel, hatchet, rake, grooming brush, sickle, and more.

A great [Woodcutting](/skills/woodcutting) grind uses a higher QL hatchet for chopping down trees and a "skiller" hatchet for cutting up logs.
