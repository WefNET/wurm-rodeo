[Meditating](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Meditating) is a long haul skill with great benefits that takes months and months (and years) to grind due to daily limits in skill gain.

## The Basics

### Rugs and Quality

When you're starting out, you want a high (90+) CoC enchanted rug at about 50ql, although rug quality doens't matter until you hit level 20 in skill. By the time you hit 40 skill, this rug can be ground down to 1ql for the best skill gain chances. This is a "[skiller](/skills/skilers)".

You will use this 1ql rug for the rest of your grind from level 40 and beyond. Keep it repaired!

### Maximize Meditations Per Day

You get 5 meditation skill gain chances per real-life day, with 30 minutes between. After you reach 5, you get a chance every 3 hours. This gives you 9 chances a day to raise your skill.

The recent UI advancements in [Timers](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Timers) has made it much easier to track your Meditating chances over time.

If you want to grind meditating, you need to master the clock.

### Getting Path Questions

The common wisdom is that you want a high QL rug to receive Path Questions when you medidate on a special tile.
