[Mining](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Mining) in Wurm Online is a fundamental skill which is required to gather resources for other primary skills, like Masonry, Smithing, and more.

## The Basics

### Vein Difficulty

Like all things Wurm, each vein or ore type has a specific difficulty that can you match with your skill level. Mining a less difficult vein at a higher skill will produce less skill gain chances.

**Note:** You only gain skill with a mining action if the ore / shards collected falls between the range of 1.01 to 39.99 in QL.

### Pickaxe Quality (and Enchantments)

Using the [Wurm Grinder](https://www.dreamsleeve.org/wurm/grinder/) you can pinpoint the optimal pickaxe QL (and/or vein target) based on your Mining skill and Pickaxe skill.

Most likely, you will see best gains using a "[skiller](/skills/skillers)" type pickaxe at 1QL with a high as possible CoC enchant. You want long action timers, so no WoA is needed.

You can save your high QL / imbued / runed / WoA enchanted pickaxe when you are mining for ore quality for imping lumps.

### Recommended Grind

| Skill | Vein |
|-:|:-|
| 0-70 | Rock / Iron |
| 60-100 | Copper / Slate / Lead |
| 80+ | Silver |
| 90+ | Gold |
| 99+ | Sandstone |

### Other Techniques

Flattening a cave roof can produce up to 100 skill ticks per click, dependent on stamina. This is a method of AFK mining, with a long timer. I use this with alts to build Body Strength.
