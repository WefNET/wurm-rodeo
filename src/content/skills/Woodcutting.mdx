## The Basics

Woodcutting in Wurm Online is an important gathering skill that helps with Carpentry and its related skills. Since wood has many uses, becoming skilled in Woodcutting is very important.

### Difficulties

Chopping down a tree has a difficulty based on tree age. Cutting up felled trees has a difficult based on tree type. You best target trees to chop down are "overaged". Tree type difficulties range from 2-20. Most trees types fall into the 2-10 range, but some have a higher difficulty:

| Tree Type | Difficulty |
|:-|-:|
|Pine, Cedar, Birch, Fir, Linden, others | 2-10 |
|Walnut | 15|
|Willow | 18|
|Oak |20|

### The Gear

For chopping down trees, a higher QL hatchet with WoW and CoC enchants will serve you bests. You want to maximize the quality of your felled trees for cutting and using the logs for crafting.

When cutting felled trees, you want a high CoC enchanted hatchet at 1ql known commonly as a "skiller".

## The Grind

From 1-80 skill, you chop down and cut up anything and everything. Load all the felled trees you chopped down into a wagon. You can get just over 60 felled trees in a wagon at a time. Haul the wagon back home to your "chopping station"***, activate your 1ql hatchet, turn on sleep bonus and get cutting.

From 80 skill onwards, you should focus on more difficult trees. This means finding or making a walnut grove, or using a Fo priest to "[wild growth](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Wild_growth)" enchant up an area full of Willows or Oaks. _Note_: Willows and Oaks will only kill nearby trees when they age up naturally.

***My chopping station is situatated near a crate rack and crates that I have setup with dedicated QL levels for storage. You do need high QL logs of imping after all.

I'd recommend getting yourself a nice wound to grind with, as getting trees to grind with is pretty hard at higher levels. You can also go around deforesting everything still, but skillgain for WC drops hard after 80 skill if you're cutting down birch/pine/whatever.
