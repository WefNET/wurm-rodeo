Since my Vynora priest is the ropemaker in the family, skilling one rope at a time, I wanted to skillup [Ropemaking](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Ropemaking) on my main using improvement to help make some ropes-stuff.

### The Start

> Starting Ropemaking skill: **50.03**.

### The Setup

#### ðŸŽ¯ Imp Targets

I have 4x fish keep nets higher than my skill in quality:

Sadly, my current skill is too low to imp these into the ["sweet spot"](/skills/sweet-spot). At 50 skill, the sweet-spot begins at 61.50. This number will get higher and higher as my grind progresses, so I put a Copper Rune of Vynora [rune](/skills/runes#copper-rune-of-vynora) on each to make them easier to improve at a high level.

[19:15:29] A copper rune of Vynora has been attached, so it will have a higher chance to be successfully improved (7.5%)

#### ðŸ§µ Imp Tools

I have my [cloth tailoring](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Cloth_tailoring) improvement tools ready to go in my toolbelt. The ropemaker's grind is particularly heavy on strings, since the imp-able items for ropemaking weigh 10kgs. I prep multiple 64x bundles of strings just because of this:

### The Grind

#### Round 1

**7:20pm** Time to start, the kids are asleep, and I'm watching the movie "Catch Me If You Can" on PlutoTV. Yes, I've seen it about a million times, and it's all good. Mindless entertainment goes well with a Wurm skill grind.

**7:50pm** Check-in

> [19:51:26] Ropemaking increased by 0.0109 to 50.8683

My water is more than half gone, the strings are almost gone, and Leonardo DiCaprio wants to be a pilot.

I refresh my water, get more strings, then keep going.

By the top of the hour, I decide to try to get one fish keep net imped into the sweet-spot. Since my skill is nearer 50, the sweet spot was too far away.

**8:20pm**

> [20:19:14] Ropemaking increased by 0.0138 to 51.5770

That one fish keep net is just under the sweet-spot QL, but now my strings are too low in QL to continue the imps. I take this as a signal to stop and go do something else.

### Total gains

> **1.54** gained in Ropemaking in 1 hour.

### Lessons Learned

My options for better skill gains are:

1) Coffee? I could have used coffee to double my gains from sleep bonus.
2) Imp items into the sweet-spot, but as I may have mentioned before, it's hard to hit the sweet-spot at a lower level in skill. It starts getting better above 57 skill.
3) Affinity foods? I could have used Affinity food or drink to eke out another 10% of skill gains.
4) Remove [Wind of Ages](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Wind_of_ages) casts from imping tools to focus on longer action timers.
