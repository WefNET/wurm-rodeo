I've decided to concentrate on a grinding one skill a week in order to help my scattered ADHD brain. There are a variety of skills I'd like to focus on in Wurm Online, but the grindfest is usually very much whim based. I'll be using this space to document my progress and thoughts on the skill of the week.

### The Skills

- Fine Carpentry,
- Plate Armor Smithing,
- Bowery,
- Natural Substances,
- Weapon Smithing,
- Shield Bashing,
- **Animal Husbandry**,
- Pottery,
- Woodcutting,
- Baking

### The Skill of the Week Plan

I'll pick one skill randomly on Sunday night and grind that skill through the week, while taking notes on my progress.

### The Week's Skill: Animal Husbandry

I rolled a 7 out of 10 on [Roll-A-Die](https://rolladie.net/roll-a-d10-die), so that means I'll be focusing on Animal Husbandry this week. I've put some time already in setting up my farm for animals. I have a pen for rams, more for sheep, and one for cows. I have a few horses, including old 5-speeds. My deed is surrounded by a several paddocks, but some are unfinished.

> Starting Animal Husbandry Skill: 67.164

### Goals

- Grind AH skill to 70.
- Get all deed animals branded and in the Wurm Assistant Granger tool.
- Finish the paddocks around the deed.
- Add a pen for bison, find wilds, and begin my bison breeding program.
- Breed and cull wilds to restock the breeding lines in all pens.
- Maintain pens, replacing packed tiles with grass.
- MAYBE: reactivate my Fo priest to continue grinding to 70 faith to able to cast [Genesis](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Genesis).

#### Goal - Grind AH skill to 70

Each round of grooming my animals gives me about 0.250 skill. Grooming resets after an hour, so I can groom my animals twice an evening. I can also shear my sheep and milk my cows for a little extra skill. Also, I can breed my animals for a small skill gain.

##### Monday update

I got my AH skill to 67.784, grooming everything 3 times *thud*.

##### Tuesday update

I got my AH skill to 68.066, grooming everything once.

##### Wednesday update

I got my AH skill to 68.649, grooming everything 3 times *ugggh*.

##### Thursday update

I got my AH skill to 68.790, grooming everything once. *I'm not going to make it!*

##### Friday update

I didn't play much, but I got my AH skill to 69.117, grooming everything twice. *I'm so close!*

##### Saturday update

I got my AH skill to 69.757, grooming everything three times. *End in sight!*

##### Sunday update

[13:07:21] You have just received the title 'Granger'!

I did it! I got my AH skill to 70.000. I'm now a Granger! This goal is complete, but will I ever tend to my animals again?

#### Goal - Get all deed animals branded and in the Wurm Assistant Granger tool.

The [Wurm Assistant](https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/68031-wurm-assistant-enrich-your-wurm-experience/) is an amazing helper tool for Wurm Online. It has a Granger tool that allows you to keep track of your animals, their traits, and their breeding lines. I have a few animals in the tool, but I need to get all my deed animals in there.

##### Thursday update

Everthing animal worthy of listing in the Granger tool is listed. I have a few wilds that I've been using for shield trainig, so those are not listed.

##### Sunday update

I have all my deed animals (that I are about) in the Granger tool. This goal is complete.

#### Goal - Finish the paddocks around the deed.

When I re-did my deed earlier in 2024, I made perimiter lining paddocks for animals. These 12 x 1 buildings feature six 2x2 tile pens for breeding pairs. I have a few paddocks that are unfinished. I need to finish them.

- Build fences around the pens.
- Add gates to the pens.
- Render the plain stone walls to make them look nice.

##### Tuesday update

I finished one of the paddocks around the deed. I added fences, gates, and rendered the walls. I also added some lead lamps in each pen to make them cozy for the breeding pairs. Hopefully, that will help with the breeding.

##### Sunday update

I finished all the paddocks around the deed, but I didn't finish the pens, so this is a big fail.

#### Goal - Add a pen for bison, find wilds, and begin my bison breeding program.

I have a few bison in my breeding lines, but I need to find some wilds to add to the breeding lines. I also need to build a pen for them.

##### Monday update

I created an 8x8 pen for the bison, so 64 tiles total. I found 2 sets of breeding pairs of bison in the wild. I added them to the pen, groomed them, and fed them. I also bred them. They have already packed a tile!

##### Thursday update

I found 10 bison in the wild. I added them to the pen and groomed them. 4 out of the 7 females are pregnant, with three studs just standing around packing tiles. Hopefully this it the start of a good breeding line.

##### Friday update

All 7 of my female bison are pregnant!

##### Sunday update

I'd say this goal is complete. I have a good breeding line of bison going.

<hr />

#### Goal - Breed and cull wilds to restock the breeding lines in all pens.

I need to breed my animals to keep the breeding lines strong. I also need to cull the weak animals to keep the lines strong.

##### Tuesday update

By Tuesday, I had bred 19 females, but that went back to last week. Some of my stock is still too young for breeding, so I need to wait for them to mature.

##### Thursday update

I'm counting 4 new lambs and 2 new calves. I'm going to have to cull some of the older animals to make room for the new ones, but only after I get my AH skill to 70.

##### Sunday update

I haven't culled any animals yet, but I have bred quite a few that haven't been hatched yet. I'm going to kill off my wild male sheep and cows to make room for the new little ones.

<hr />

#### Goal - Maintain pens, replacing packed tiles with grass.

I need to keep my pens maintained. I need to replace packed tiles with grass to keep my animals happy.

##### Sunday update

I've been keeping up with the pens, and I have replaced only a few packed tiles with grass. I'm sure the animals are and saving up their packing for next week.

<hr />

#### Potential Goal - Reactivate my Fo priest to continue grinding to 70 faith in to able to cast Genesis.

I need to grind my faith to 70 to be able to cast Genesis. I may need to reactivate my Fo priest to do this.

##### Sunday update

No, I didn't do this. I was waiting for any Black Friday deals!
