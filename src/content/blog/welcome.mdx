Tending to the garlic.

## Wurm Things

I've been skilling lately, as have you all. Skilling is to Wurm as cheese is to milk. (and Dairy food making is one of my lowest skills.) When I first got in Wurm Online, 10 years ago, I decided to "go deep" in Chain Armour Smithing (CAS). I made some decent money, and I got my CAS skill up to 98.95. At this point, I have zero motivation to grind that last 0.05 to 99. Other skills demand my limited attention these days.

### Farming

I have low to mid 90s in farming skill. I need farming to support my cooking, ropemaking, and cloth tailoring skills.

I transformed my deed for a year (with lots of breaks in between) to help me grind my farming skill. I lowered my entire 51 x 61 plot by 50 dirts per tile. I hit some rocks, but not too much. In the end I moved over 150,000 dirts. I rebuilt all of my buildings, using thousands of the brick and mortar I had saved up. At the end of the project, I had carved out 2x 600 tile farming plots to skill with. Previously I had 180 tiles dedicated to farm plus an off-deed strip of about 120 more. I had no idea how big 1,200 farming tiles could be!

I planted 300 wemp to start out, in 6 strips of 50 tiles. I needed more wemp for my priest to make cordage ropes for favor. During the growth session, I tended 3-4 times per tile and got no skill gains. That's understandable. Wemp is a lower difficulty crop. I was able to harvest a nice batch of 2,500 wemp, with about 10% lower quality harvests decicated just for seeds.

Next up I did 600 garlic. After planting, I used Asdf's [Grinder](https://www.dreamsleeve.org/wurm/grinder/) to determine the best rake QL for garlic. I punched in my skill numbers, then tried a few rake QLs to find a maximum 52.07% skill gain with a 72 QL rake. I created a 72ql rake and cast a 90+ power CoC enchant on it.

[06:42:32] A tool for working the fields. The rake needs to be sharpened with a whetstone.
[06:42:32] You can barely make out the signature of its maker, 'Jack.o.es'.
[06:42:32] Circle of Cunning has been cast on it, so it will increase skill gained with it when used. [98]

Grinder did the trick! I made roughly 0.20 skill gains for tending 600x garlics with my new rake. It took around 75 minutes to tend.

1,200 farming tiles might have been too much for one guy to manage; I have not yet to farm the second plot of 600 tiles.

### Botany and Forgaging

With 600x fallow farming tiles, I have lots of space for [resource nodes](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Resource_nodes) to grow. I've been running around daily with my CoC enchanted cloth gloves and filling backpacks full of stuff. (I discard the rock shards, branches, and iron rocks.) I can focus on the nodes I care more about, which means that my botanaizing is outpacing my foraging skill for the time being.

Also, the rare coins are nice. I love the silver ones!

### Other highlights

- **Woodcutting**: I just got high enough in skill (plus hatchet enchants and imbues) to harvest 90ql logs.
- **Beverages**: I have about 300 teas growing to harvest every day. I toast then to gain beverage skill, which is now up to 84.
- **Natural Substances**: I've had tons of animal bits lying around for years, and I've started to grind through them with coffee and sleep bonus.
