### Starting As a Vynora Priest

Everyone's first priest is a Vynora priest. It's the most versatile priest for a new player. You can cast skill and speed improvements on your own tools, and you can also cast your own protective spells for your armor. Vynora followers also get a 10% skill gain bonus on most skills, so it makes sense to start here.

Once you see all the casted tools in the trade channel and the prices they go for, you'll want to start casting your own tools. You'll need to get your channeling skill up to 50 to cast the first spell, Circle of Cunning (CoC). This spell is the most important spell for a crafter, as it increases the skill gains for the skills you are grinding.

When you get a 63 power CoC cast on your lindenwood rope tool, you'll feel invincible!

But something will happen. You'll have animals to tend to or fix, and that "Genesis" spell will be calling your name. Soon you'll be reading all about Fo on the Wurmpedia.

### Rolling Up a Fo Priest

Working on the farm is hard business. When you start grinding toward making 4-speed donkeys, you'll want to have a Fo priest. Fo priests can cast spells like Genesis, which can remove bad traits from your precious bred-in-captiviy spawns.

When you dig into the Wurmpedia, you'll see that Fo priests and followers have many benefits in the "life" category. Healing bonuses and spells, benefical animal spells, and charms, and the ability to cast spells like "Life Transfer" on your weapons are all very appealing.

You need 100 favor to cast Life Transfer, so you'll need to grind up your faith to 100, an everlong slog that will make you question your life choices.

While you're waiting, that mine that you opened as a noob is caving in. You'll need to get a Magranon priest to cast "Strongwall" to save your mine.

### Your Desperate Need for a Magranon Priest

Magranon priests are the most sought after priests in the game. They can cast "Strongwall" to save your mine, and they can also cast "Fire Protection" on your jewelry to protect you from [Lava Fiends](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Lava_fiend). If Fo is the priest of life, Magranon is the priest of the earth, benefical in a mine, but also handy in a fight with bonuses to fighting subskills, weapons, and armor.

As you fix your mine, one tile at a time with your 3-minute long Strongwall casts, you'll start to see the benefits of having a Magranon priest. After a few tiles, you'll understand the value of just spamming out support beams.

As a Magranon priest, you'll be able to cast "Stone Strike" on your pickaxe to help you with the ever enjoyable task of surface mining. I hear when you get 9,000 stone shards, you can finally start building that castle you've always dreamed of.

### The End Game

Finally, you have rolled up all the specialized priests you need. You have a Vynora priest for your crafting, a Fo priest for your animals, and a Magranon priest for your mine. You can now cast all the spells you need to be a self-sufficient Wurmian. But something will be lacking as you grind your Vynora priest to make items for sale. CoC and WoA, CoC and WoA, forever and ever and ever.

That "Blessings of the Dark" (BOTD) spell that Liblia priests can cast will be calling your name. You'll start to see the value of having a Liblia priest in your stable. You'll be able to cast BOTD on your tools with a single spell and be done with it!

Should you roll up a Liblia priest? Or should you convert one of your precious white-lighters with a [Faith Swap](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Faith#Faith_swap) for 27,000 marks? Do you really want to carve out a little area of death for a Liblia altar?

In the meantime, you'll have lots of time to reflect while you're waiting for your prayers to wrap up, your enchants to finish, and your sermon timers to tick down!
