There's usually a spurt of players returning to Wurm whenever something new is released. In recent years, the returns have been diminishing.

### New Items

Every month a new skin is released.

### New Skills

Skills are what the game is all about in my opinion. Getting higher skills is an accomplishment that all Wurm players espouse.

#### Cartography

That last skill added was Cartography. Sadly Cartography didn't scratch my itch. I loved the concept of making maps, trading maps, stamping maps, etc. Beyond asthetics, maps serve no practical benefit. The possible connection to Treasure Maps was interesting for about 5 seconds, until you realize the Treasure Maps are from a point in time in the past and not based on current topographies.




Of course, the danger is that any new skill becomes like coffee / tea, did to the Beverages skill. What once took years and years of grinding was reduced to a few months of roasting and toasting, without the need to measure a gram of water.
