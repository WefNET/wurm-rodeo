### Starting As a Vynora Priest

Everyone's first priest is a Vynora priest. It's the most versatile priest for a new player. You can cast skill and speed improvements on your own tools, and you can also cast your own protective spells for your armor. Vynora followers also get a 10% skill gain bonus on most skills, so it makes sense to start here.

Once you see all the casted tools in the trade channel and the prices they go for, you'll want to start casting your own tools. You'll need to get your channeling skill up to 50 to cast the first spell, Circle of Cunning (CoC). This spell is the most important spell for a crafter, as it increases the skill gains for the skills you are grinding.

When you get a 63 power CoC cast on your lindenwood rope tool, you'll feel invincible!

But something will happen. You'll have animals to tend to or fix, and that Genesis spell will be calling your name. Soon you'll be reading all about Fo on the Wurmpedia.

### Rolling Up a Fo Priest



One off:

1) You have animals to tend, you need a Fo.
2) You have a cave to tend, you need a Magranon.

Vyn priest is great, but need to only csat one spell for Coc and WoA. Plus WA is superior to AoSP, so you swap VYN for LIB.
