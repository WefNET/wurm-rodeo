Start out as Vyn for the skill gain bonus.
Roll a Vyn priest alt to cast your tools.
One off:

1) You have animals to tend, you need a Fo.
2) You have a cave to tend, you need a Magranon.

Vyn priest is great, but need to only csat one spell for Coc and WoA. Plus WA is superior to AoSP, so you swap VYN for LIB.
