[Shield Bashing](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Shield_bashing) is a battle skill that has both offensive and defensive capabilities. Because shield bashing is a timed, manual triggered skill, it is hard to grind.

## The Basics

### Pen Training

A well-known technique to grind shield skills in general, is "pen training". Essentially you fence in some animals as a way to quickly engage and disengage attacks. The consensus is that starving trolls and hell scorpious are good to pen. Each need to be [Dominated](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Dominate) by a Magranon priest to be able to be moved into their pens.

Basically, you enter the pen with a difficult to kill creature, in any stance, with a nicely CoC enchanted shield and no weapon wielded, then you wait for the bashing skill timer to elapse, then bash. As the creature gets damaged by the bashing, you can stop and move the next pen, if available.
