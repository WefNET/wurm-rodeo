[Shield Bashing](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Shield_bashing) is a battle skill that has both offensive and defensive capabilities. Because shield bashing is a timed, manual triggered skill, it is hard to grind.

## The Basics

You'll wear your armor and a shield, but no weapon. Your shield should be enchanted with <Definition text="CoC" title="Circle of Cunning" link="https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Circle_of_cunning" /> to enhance your skill gains. Plan to utilize [Sleep Bonus](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Sleep_bonus) in your shield grinds, because it does affect your fighting subskill gains.

### Pen Training

A well-known technique to grind shield skills, in general, is "pen training". Essentially you fence in some animals as a way to quickly engage and disengage attacks. The consensus is that starving trolls and hell scorpious are good to pen. Each need to be [Dominated](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Dominate) by a Magranon priest to be able to be moved into their pens.

Basically, you enter the pen with a difficult-to-kill creature, in any stance, with a nicely CoC enchanted shield and no weapon wielded, then you wait for the shield bash skill timer to elapse, then bash. As the creature gets too damaged by the bashing, you can stop and move to the next pen, if available.
