[Shield Bashing](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Shield_bashing) is a battle skill that has both offensive and defensive capabilities. Because shield bashing is a timed, manual triggered skill, it is hard to grind.

## The Basics

You'll wear your armor and a shield, but no weapon. Your shield should be enchanted with <Definition text="CoC" title="Circle of Cunning" link="https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Circle_of_cunning" /> to enhance your skill gains. Plan to utilize [Sleep Bonus](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Sleep_bonus) in your shield grinds, because it does affect your fighting subskill gains.

### Pen Training

A well-known technique to grind shield skills, in general, is "pen training". Essentially you fence in some animals as a way to quickly engage and disengage attacks. The consensus is that starving trolls and hell scorpious are good to pen. Each need to be [Dominated](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Dominate) by a Magranon priest to be able to be moved into their pens.

Basically, you enter the pen with a difficult-to-kill creature, in any stance, with a nicely CoC enchanted shield and no weapon wielded, then you wait for the shield bash skill timer to elapse, then bash. As the creature gets too damaged by the bashing, you can stop and move to the next pen, if available.




{/* Mallenril (Pri) Getting whacked by a bison could work too, if I'm at around 3 shield skill?
[06:16:17] <Hasimira> (Pri) whenever I pick up a new shield type I like to pen train on bison til like 30ish. the funny thing w shield skill is the first 10/20 points suck because you have low skill so wont block so wont gain. it reallyt picks up after like 30
[06:16:30] <Mallenril> (Pri) I see.
[06:16:56] <Hasimira> (Pri) when its a penned, tamed bison youll only have like 15ish mins before skill gain dries up. Itll reset after 4 hours iirc. So if you have enough bison you can just kinda cycle through em.
[06:17:00] <Toeol> you can only pen train on the same animal for about 15 minutes
[06:17:16] <Toeol> and then yes, 4 hours
[06:17:25] <Mallenril> (Pri) Lower animals too weak btw? Like a bull?
[06:17:40] <Hasimira> (Pri) Best results for me unmounted, defensive stance, toggled in and out to set facing, wearing some beater plate, with an alt first aiding me while i get bonked. Spam shieldbash too.
[06:18:04] <Hasimira> (Pri) Can do a bull and pig but the skill really likes harder hits and bison hit just a lil harder than those things while still being pretty manageable ^^
[06:18:29] <Mallenril> (Pri) I see. Thanks, that's a lot of good information :-) */}
