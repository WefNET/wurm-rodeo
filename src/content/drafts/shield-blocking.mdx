[Shield Bashing](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Shield_bashing) is a battle skill that has both offensive and defensive capabilities. Because shield bashing is a timed, manual triggered skill, it is hard to grind.

## The Basics

You'll wear your armor and a shield, but no weapon. Your shield should be enchanted with Definition text="CoC" title="Circle of Cunning" link="https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Circle_of_cunning" / to enhance your skill gains. Plan to utilize [Sleep Bonus](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Sleep_bonus) in your shield grinds, because it does affect your fighting subskill gains.

### Pen Training

A well-known technique to grind shield skills, in general, is "pen training". Essentially you fence in some animals as a way to quickly engage and disengage attacks. The consensus is that starving trolls and hell scorpious are good to pen. Each need to be [Dominated](https://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Dominate) by a Magranon priest to be able to be moved into their pens.

Basically, you enter the pen with a difficult-to-kill creature, in any stance, with a nicely CoC enchanted shield and no weapon wielded, then you wait for the shield bash skill timer to elapse, then bash. As the creature gets too damaged by the bashing, you can stop and move to the next pen, if available.




{/* Mallenril (Pri) Getting whacked by a bison could work too, if I'm at around 3 shield skill?
[06:16:17] Hasimira (Pri) whenever I pick up a new shield type I like to pen train on bison til like 30ish. the funny thing w shield skill is the first 10/20 points suck because you have low skill so wont block so wont gain. it reallyt picks up after like 30
[06:16:30] Mallenril (Pri) I see.
[06:16:56] Hasimira (Pri) when its a penned, tamed bison youll only have like 15ish mins before skill gain dries up. Itll reset after 4 hours iirc. So if you have enough bison you can just kinda cycle through em.
[06:17:00] Toeol you can only pen train on the same animal for about 15 minutes
[06:17:16] Toeol and then yes, 4 hours
[06:17:25] Mallenril (Pri) Lower animals too weak btw? Like a bull?
[06:17:40] Hasimira (Pri) Best results for me unmounted, defensive stance, toggled in and out to set facing, wearing some beater plate, with an alt first aiding me while i get bonked. Spam shieldbash too.
[06:18:04] Hasimira (Pri) Can do a bull and pig but the skill really likes harder hits and bison hit just a lil harder than those things while still being pretty manageable ^^
[06:18:29] Mallenril (Pri) I see. Thanks, that's a lot of good information :-) */}

{/* [20:23:23] Graymist is there a trick to training small shields vs medium or large?  they level so much slower than other type of shields
[20:23:39] Cesaille there's no difference afaik
[20:23:49] Cesaille it's reliant on shield ql a lot at low levels
[20:24:00] Graymist I'm using a 75QL shield
[20:24:08] Cesaille skill?
[20:24:24] Graymist all are same QL,  small shield is 7, which is what the other skills were
[20:24:34] Cesaille im not sure sry
[20:24:47] Cesaille are yu in the same place as before?
[20:24:56] Assembly Cesaille what map you on?
[20:24:58] Onnawa the smaller the shield, the more dependent it is on your actual "Shields" skill
[20:25:01] Cesaille deli atm
[20:25:14] Graymist yeah, I can switch shields and see skill ticks with other types
[20:25:31] Cesaille has anything else changed? literally anything
[20:25:38] Graymist so best to level larger shields, then mediums then smalls?
[20:25:43] Cesaille things like domain bonus from altars can screw with it
[20:25:48] Onnawa the smaller the shield, the harder it is to block
[20:26:03] Cesaille that's not true, all shields have the same block
[20:26:12] Onnawa that's not what i said
[20:26:51] Cesaille they bash faster and have different windows to block arrows but in melee they are functionally the same
[20:27:07] Yooperman nu uhn
[20:27:50] Onnawa large shield block is based primarily off large shield skill. medium shield is more of a hybrid between Medium Shields and Base Skill, and Small Shield runs more off of Small Shield skill...at least until levels are high
[20:28:59] Graymist thanks for the info, I'll just level the large shields up to 30 then do medium to 30 then start on smalls
[20:29:56] Graymist they all are going slow
[20:30:32] Graymist at least defensive fighting is going up fast
[20:30:58] Yooperman just keep beating off the goblins
[20:31:16] Graymist letting bulls and bison beat on me */}
