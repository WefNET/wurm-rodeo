[06:52:03] Albrun if you want to skill archery, should you use low ql arrows and/or bows like with tools?
[06:55:01] Cesaille No, it's like weapons where more ql = more damage = more skill
[06:55:16] Cesaille That being said imping thousands of arrows is a fate worse than death so strike a balance
[06:55:22] Albrun ok! ty
[06:55:31] Zenity Accuracy too, higher ql = more hits = more skill
[06:55:55] Cesaille Get yourself a BT bow if you haven't. It's cheap or free to get cast and might as well grind it up
