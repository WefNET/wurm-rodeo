I've decided that tonight, I'm going to focus on grinding Natural Substances. But first, an apology: I'm sorry this isn't a 3 hour YouTube video or stream!


Starting skill 65.54

Potency Target = 15, which is Eye + Heart, ql of boh were 51-52ql

COC 80ish on the eye(s), 2x 

Coffee + SB, 100 covers

100x

[20:16:56] Natural substances increased by 0.0155 to 66.1716

39 ticks total, based on HC QL of 0-40 range

next round, same setup, but forgot SB until more than half way through, because I was distracted by workers in my neighborhood working past 7pm, which they are not allow to do.

[20:54:05] Natural substances increased by 0.0103 to 66.3619

28 clicks total, a failed effort.

My options for better skill gains are:

    1) Lower quality materials and/or
    2) Higher potency healing cover targets
